Manual archiving trigger plugin for the [Moodle archiving subsystem](https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-local_archiving/).

You can find more information about the archiving subsystem in the [official documentation](https://archiving.gandrass.de/).


## Features

- Allows to manually create archive jobs via the job creation form of the archiving subsystem core
- Manual archive jobs can be fully customized via the Moodle web interface during job creation
- Allows manual archive creation to be enabled or disabled


## Installation

Archiving triggers (`archivingtrigger`) are sub-plugins of the archiving subsystem core (`local_archiving`) and
therefore require the core plugin to be installed. They then must be placed inside your Moodle directory under
`local/archiving/driver/trigger`.

You can find detailed installation instructions within the [official documentation](https://archiving.gandrass.de/).
If you have problems installing this plugin or have further questions, please feel free to open an issue within the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-local_archiving/issues).
